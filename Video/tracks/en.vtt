00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.080
Oh! I am flying the flight of Love, high in the sky

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.940
I am hungover with the feeling of Love

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.400
Oh! I am flying the flight of Love, high in the sky

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:46.360
I am hungover with the feeling of Love

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.460
My feet do not even touch the ground

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.880
There are endless springs and fountains of Love (everywhere I look)

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.960
And at night, sweet sweet dreams disturb me

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.700
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.580
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.780
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.700
Even if I desired to, I cannot stop my heart

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.740
I have taken a step into the realm of love

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.240
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.800
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.460
I will take the universe into my arms

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.680
To whom can I explain this feeling of love

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.580
I will take the universe into my arms

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.220
To whom can I explain this feeling of love

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:13.480
Yes, even the flowers seem brighter and more saturate

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.860
The water of love has washed their petals

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.940
For today I have fallen in love with thee

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.840
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.720
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.520
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.740
Even if I desired to, I cannot stop my heart

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.840
I have taken a step into the realm of love

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.060
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.720
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:02.760
This tale of my love is an epic story

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.640
Oh! This tale of my love is an epic story

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:17.060
I feel shy when I see myself in (interact with the) mirror

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.240
I’ve not slept for ages, I have not even brushed upon my hair

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.480
Not slept, I have not even brushed upon my hair

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.540
I cannot tell of my condition, nor can I hide it

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.740
Such is the effect of their eyes, they have failed to understand

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.140
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.300
Yes! These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.020
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.480
Even if I desired to, I can not stop my heart

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.720
I have taken a step into the realm of love

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.780
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.640
These stranger’s eyes have connected with me

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.720
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.760
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.040
Only they are attached to true love

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.860
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:34.920
Only they are attached to true love

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.800
Yes, in my very pores, Satinder is embedded

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.680
In my very pores, Satinder is embedded

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.260
My own ‘parandi’ (ponytail) is stinging me (like a snake bite)

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.980
For as long as he discreetly smiled at me

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.820
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.500
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.520
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.960
Even if I desired to, I cannot stop my heart

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.100
I have taken a step into the realm of love

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.700
I have lost myself, I have lost myself

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:23.220
Oh! They whom are protected by the eye of the lord
