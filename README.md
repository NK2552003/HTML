INTROduCTioN 

If you're a person whose mother-tongue is not English, the chances 
are, you've learnt English in the 'non-natural way'. That is, you've 
learnt English in a way that is opposite to the way of natural lan­
guage acquisition. 

You know, the natural way of acquiring a language is to learn to 
speak it first and then to write it. 

Those people who do not learn English the natural way, know 
reasonable English - or even excellent English. And if you ask 
them to write a report or something in English, they may do it 
fairly well. But, if you ask them to speak to you about the same 
thing, they find it hard to do. Or even impossible. 

When they start speaking, most of the words remain on the tip of 
their tongue and don't readily come out. And often, what words 
do come out sound disconnected and random. And, they find 
themselves speaking in a clumsy and unclear way, with long gaps 
and intervals of indecision between every two words. And they 
keep fumbling for something to say. Not only this, they fmd it 
difficult to go on beyond one or two lines, without tripping up 
and without stumbling over the sounds or sequences of sounds. 

And then, they tend to fall back upon their mother-tongue - or 
become tongue-tied. This book will help you to overcome all these 
problems and will also help you in developing better speaking 
skills.

CONTRACTioNS 

Contraction means to shorten a word or phrase by omitting one 
or more sounds or letters from it. The word so formed is also 
called a contraction. Discussed below are the various contractions 
used in spoken English. 

The apostrophe has two uses: 

1. To show that we have made words shorter. We have contracted 
them. 

2. To show that something belongs to someone, i.e. they possess 
it. (possession) 

Here are two examples. 

• My dad's car is red. 

Here we hive only one dad but we have put on the letter's' be­
cause we have put an apostrophe. It shows that the car belongs to 
dad. 

• "I'll tell you that later," he whispered. 

I will has become I'll, we have joined two words and missed out 
the letters WI and put in the apostrophe instead. 

We use apostrophes because it can make our writing easier to 
read. 

In the list below we are going to look at apostrophes for contract-

Let's start with Let)s. Except for some set phrases (example: 'Let 
us pray') let us is almost always expressed as a contraction: Let)s. 

Example: 

• Let's go! 

It is almost always used to express an imperative, thus: 

• Let's do it! 

However, sometimes it is used to express something like an ad­
monition, thus:

• Let's do what we ought to do. 

Sometimes it is used to make suggestion, thus: 

• Let's keep this just between us.

let's' .

PRONUNCiATioN 

The first English lesson should deal with pronunciation. When 
you don't do pronunciation first, you have to do something else 
than pronunciation. And then whatever you do and if it involves 
speaking, then bad pronunciation habits are formed. 

If you don't know how to pronounce and yet you pronounce your 
own way at the beginning of your learning, then you are building 
your habits in the wrong way. Learning words without pronuncia­
tion on the first lesson is damaging. 

There are two possibilities that are recommended: (1) learn pro­
nunciation from the beginning and speak from the beginning, (2) 
learn without pronunciation, but do not speak (you will start speak­
ing at a later stage - after learning pronunciation). 

The idea is not to have 'perfect' pronunciation from the beginning 
but 'correct' - understood in the following sense: (1) use the right 
sounds - perhaps your own versions of the English sounds, but 
make sure that there is a clear correspondence between your own 
sounds and the English sounds (2) always stress the right syl­
lable. 

Additionally, it's a good idea to be able to phonetically transcribe 
your own English output. This means that you will have conscious 
control over your output. You will have a 'digital perception' of 
your pronunciation - as opposed to an 'analog perception', which 
is usually developed by learners. 



1\ Pronunciation 25
11 

If you have a digital perception of your pronunciation, you have 
the following advantage: 

If, through practice, you have mastered the ability to produce a 
particular English sound, say [@], you will be able to incorporate 
this new ability into each occurrence of this sound in your utter­
ances because in every word you utter you know whether it con­
tains this sound or not. (Learners who don't have a digital percep­
tion can learn to perfectly pronounce 'cat' and still be unable to 
say 'man' properly.) 

DEfiNiTioN of Good PRONUNCiATioN 

Definition of good pronunciation is: 

( 1) easy to understand by advanced users of English, 

(2) pleasant to hear for advanced users of English, 

(3) easy to pronounce for oneself. 

DON'T WORRY AbOUT flUENCY'" SPEAkiNG slowly is OK. 

English learners are often worried about their lack of fluency. They 
need much time to build sentences and this worries them. They 
would like to speak as fast as in their native language. 

Please notice that building sentences in a foreign language is a 
real challenge for the brain. There are chemical processes that 
take place in the brain before a sentence can be built in a foreign 
language. Those processes take more time than building sentences 
in one's native language. At least in the beginning. Fluency comes 
with time and practice and it should not to be expected in the 
beginning of learning. 

If you are an English learner who worries about lack of fluency, 
please remember these words: When you speak too fast, your 
brain does not have the time to build correct sentences. You have 
to speak so slowly that your brain has the time to think about 
building sentences in English. 



11 26 Spoken English II 
It's a general opinion that it is a good habit to speak slowly and 
carefully in a foreign language. 

Learners should accept the fact that speaking in a foreign lan­
guage is more difficult than speaking in one's native language. 
There is no need to worry about this. There is little fluency in the 
beginning and this is okay. Don't worry about lack of fluency. 

HOMOplioNES 

The following list of 70 groups of homophones contains only the 
most common homophones, using relatively well-known words. 
These are headwords only. They will help you in speaking indi­
vidual words with correct pronunciation. No inflections (such as 
third person singular's' or noun plurals) are included. Most of 
these are pairs. In a few cases, a third homophone is also possible 
but has not been included for simplicity. Please note that different 
varieties and accents of English may produce variations in some 
of these pronunciations. The homophones listed here are based 
on British English.

liNkiNG iN ENGlisJ.t 

When we say a sentence in English, we join or 'link' words to each 
other. Because of this linking, the words in a sentence do not al­
ways sound the same as when we say them individually. Linking is 
very important in English. If you recognise and use linking, two 
things will happen: 

1. you will understand other people more easily 

2. other people will understand you more easily 

TJ.tERE ARE bASiCAlly TWO TypES of liNkiNG: 

• consonant > vowel 

• We link words ending with a consonant sound to words be­
ginning with a vowel sound 

• vowel > vowel 

• We link words ending with a vowel sound to words beginning 



Spoken English II 
with a vowel sound 

UNdERSTANdiNG vOWEls ANd CONSONANTS fOR liNkiNG 

To understand linking, it is important to know the difference be­
tween vowel sounds and consonant sounds. Given below is a list 
of English vowels and consonants: 

Vowels: a, e, i, 0, U 

Consonants: b, c, d, f, g, h, j, k, 1, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, V, w, x, y, z 

The list shows the letters that are vowels and consonants. But the 
important thing in linking is the sound, not the letter. Often the 
letter and the sound are the same, but not always. 

For example, the word 'pay' ends with: 

• the consonant letter 'y' 
the vowel sound {a' Here are some more examples: 

though know 

ends with the letter h w 

ends with the sound 0 0 

unifonn honest 

begins with the letter U h 

begins with the sound Y 0 

liNkiNG CONSONANT TO vowEl 

When a word ends in a consonant sound, we often move the con­
sonant sound to the beginning of the next word if it starts with a 
vowel sound. 

For example, in the phrase 'turn off': 

We write it like this: turn off 



II Pronunciation 

We say it like this: tur noff 

Remember that it's the sound that matters. In the next example, 
'have' ends with: 

• the letter 'e' (vowel) 

• the sound 'v' (consonant) 

So we link 'have' to the next word 'a', which begins with a vowel 
sound: 

We write it like this: Can I have a bit of egg? 

We say it like this: Ca-nI-ha-va-bi-to-fegg? 

liNkiNG vowEl TO vowEl 

When one word ends with a vowel sound and the next word begins 
with a vowel sound, we link the words with a sort of W or Y sound. 

If our lips are round at the end of the first word, we insert a W 
sound: 

We write it too often who is so I do all 
like this: 

We say it tooWoften whoWis soW! doWall 
like this: 

If our lips are wide at the end of the first word, we insert a Y 
sound: 

We write it I am Kay is the end she asked 
like this: 

We say it IYam KayYis theYend she 
like this: Yasked 

How TO pRONOUNCE "'Ed iN ENGlisJ.t 

The past simple tense and past participle of all regular verbs end in 
-ed. For example: 



32 Spoken English II 
11
base verb (vi) past simple (v2) past participle (v3) 

Work worked worked 

In addition, many adjectives are made from the past participle and 
so end in -ed. For example: 

• I like painted furniture. 

The question is: How do we pronounce the -ed? 

The answer is: In 3 ways - II or II or II 
If the base example example pronounce extra 
ve1-b ends in base verb*: with -ed: the -ed: syllable? 
one of these 
sounds:

unvoiced lsi fax faxed hi. 
lSI wash washed 

ItSI watch watched no 

Ikl like liked 

Voiced all other play played 
sounds, allow allowed Iell

example ... 

* note that it is the sound that is important, not the letter or spell-
ing. For example, 'fax' ends in the letter 'x' but the sound lsi, 'like' 
ends in the letter 'e' but the sound Ik/. 



II Pronunciation 

EXCEPTioNS 

The following adjectives ending in -ed are always pronounced with 
IId/; 

• aged 
• blessed 
• crooked 
• dogged 
• learned 
• naked 
• ragged 
• wicked 
• wretched 

PRONOUNciNG 'ThE' 

Normally, we pronounce 'the' with a shon sound (like 'thuh'). But 
when 'the' comes before a vowel sound, we pronounce it as a long 
'thee'. 

vowel sound we write we say 

A the apple thee apple 

E the egg thee egg 

I the ice-cream thee ice-cream 

0 the orange thee orange 

U the ugly fruit thee ugly fruit 

It is important to understand that it is what we say that matters, 
not what we write. It is the sound that matters, not the letter used 
in writing a word. So we use a long 'thee' before a vowel sound, not 
necessarily before a vowel. Look at these cases; 



we write with we say with -
.w....  

the house consonant (h) thuh house consonant sound 

the hour consonant (h) thee our vowel sound 

the university vowel (u) thuh youniversity consonant sound 

the umbrella vowel (u) thee umbrella vowel sound

ENqlisl-t PRONUNCiATioN Tips 

• Tip 1 
Do not confuse pronunciation of words with their spelling! For 
example, 'threw' and 'through', although spelled differently, are 
pronounced the same. Also, identical letters or letter clusters in 
words do not always produce the same sound. For example, the 
Cough' in 'though' and 'through' represents a different sound in 
each word. Learn to practise what you hear, not what you see. 

• Tip 2 
Imagine a sound in your mind before you say it. Try to visualise the 
positioning of your mouth and face. Think about how you are 
going to make the sound. 

• Tip 3 
While listening for specific sounds, pay attention to pauses, the 
intonation of the instructor's voice and patterns of emphasis. This 
can be just as important as the pronunciation of sounds. 

• Tip4 
The English language has many different dialects and words can 
be pronounced differently. It is important, however, that you pro­
nounce words clearly to ensure effective communication. 

• Tip 5 
You must practise what you are learning! Remember that you are 
teaching your mouth a new way to move. You are building muscles 
that you do not use in your own language. It is like going to the

VOWEls 
Vowels are formed by retraction of the back of the tongue, as in 
'father' by advancing the front of the tongue, as in 'bit' or else they 
are mixed, as in 'bird', in which the tongue is in a position half-way 
between back and front. By height they are high, as in 'hit', mid, as 
in 'hate' or low, as in 'hat'. The vowels of these three words are all 
front, but the distinctions of height apply to back and mixed vow­
els as well. Thus the u of 'full' is high-back, just as that of 'hit' is 
high front. All these vowels may be further modified by 
labialisation or rounding. Thus, if the ee of 'feel' is pronounced 
with narrowed lip-opening, we obtain the French u in clune' - the 
high-front-round. There are besides other modifications caused 
by the shape of the tongue itself. 

Of the large number of possible vowels only a small proportion is 
employed in each language. 

Again, among the special vowels of anyone language we must 
distinguish between those differences, which are distinctive, that 
is, to which differences of meaning correspond and those which 
are not. Thus the first elements of the diphthongs in 'by' and 'out' 
vary considerably: some people sound them broad as in 'father', 
some thin, as in 'man', with various ihtermediate sounds. And yet 
the meaning of the words remains unchanged. The distinction 
between the vowels of ,men' and 'man', on the other hand, though 
really slighter than that of the different pronunciations of 'by' and 
'out', is a distinctive one. 



II Vowels 

It often happens that two sounds, though formed in different ways, 
have nearly the same effect on the ear. Thus the English vowel in 
'turn' is formed in a totally different way from the French one in 
'peur', the former being an unrounded, the latter a rounded vowel 
and yet they are hardly distinguishable by an untrained ear. The 
consequence is that two such vowels are never employed together 
in the same language to distinguish the meanings of words and 
for practical purposes they may be considered as variations of the 
same vowel. Hence we have to distinguish not so much between 
sounds as between groups of sounds. One of the most important 
distinctions of these groups is that of 'close' and 'open', the open 
vowels being generally formed by a 'low' position of the tongue 
or by some other widening of the mouth passage. 

Disregarding special exceptions in individual languages, we may 
assume the following as the chief distinctive groups in language 
generally: 

(1) the dull-back, but. 

(2) the clear-back, father. 

(3) the mixeda, tum, father, gabe (German). 

(4) the high-front, bit, beat. 

(5) the close-front, etC (French). 

(6) the open-front, men, mare, man. 

ROUNdEd. 

(7) high-back, full, fool. 

(8) close-back, so (German). 

(9) open-back, folly, fall. 

(10) high-front, lune (French). 



1144 Spoken English II 

( 11) close-front, peu (French). 

(12) open-front, peur (French). 

Diphthongs are, of course, symbolised by the juxtaposition of their 
elements. The following are the English diphthongs: -

al aszn aisle. 

au " now. 

01 " boil. 

el " veil. 

ou " soul. 

Diphthongs in all languages vary greatly in their constituents and 
the above combinations must be understood as simply denoting 
general tendencies. Thus ai does not literally imply a combination 
of the a in 'father' and the i in 'bit', but merely a movement in that 
direction. We may start, not with a full-back vowel, but with a 
mixed one, which may move towards i, but without reaching it: in 
fact the commonest pronunciation of 'aisle' may be represented 
by el. In the same way ei only implies a front vowel moving up­
wards and, as a matter of fact, the starting-point may be either a 
close or open e or even the a of 'man'. Indeed ei often begins with 
a mixed vowel, in which case 'veil' is confounded with 'vile'. 

Note that ei and ou in English supply the place of close long ee and 
00, which most English people are unable to pronounce. 

ii and uu are often diphthongised in a peculiar way in English, by 
being made to end in the consonants y and w respectively, wiin 
(ween) andfuul (fool) becoming wiyn andfowl. 

Having thus laid a general foundation, we may proceed to discuss 
some special modifications required in English. 

As there is no short or close e or 0 in English, it is superfluous to 
use & and to denote the quality of sounds whose openness is al­
ways implied by their shortness. We can, therefore, discard alto­
gether in English and employ & to denote the peculiar a in 'man', 



II Vowels 

for which it would otherwise be difficult to find an appropriate 
letter. 

The longs of £ and be expressed, as with the other vowels, by 
doubling - ££) . But as this is inconvenient and as is not used in 
English, it is better to denote the long of £ byae, the separation of 
the letters implying length. Long may, on this analogy, be de­
noted byao. 

The vowel in 'rum' is open-mixed, that in 'gabe' close-mixed. 

R ANd iTS ModificATioNS. 

The consonant r in English only occurs before a vowel, either in 
the same or the next word, as in 'erring' (eriq), 'far off' (faar aof). 
When not followed by a vowel, that is, either by a pause or a 
consonant, it is weakened into - the er of 'father'. Mter aa and 00 
'the' ois absorbed, as in 'bar' (baa), 'farther' (faadha), 'her' (hoe), 
'heard' (hoed), the first two being indistinguishable from 'baa' 
and 'father'. ois sometimes dropped after ao, especially before a 
consonant, as in 'floor', 'floored', although the fulljlaoo,jlaoad are 
most usual in careful speech, especially when the a is final. Mter 
other vowels a is preserved throughout, also when the r is sounded 
as a full consonant: compare 'air' (aea), 'aired' (aead) and 'airy' 
(aeri) with 'far off' (faar aof), 'her own' (hoer oun) and 'flooring' 
(flaoriq). 

The following table will give a general idea of these changes: -

faar aof (far off) faa faadha (farther). 

hoer oun (her own) hoe hoed (heard). 

fliOriq (fearing) fiia fiiad (feared). 

aeariq (airing) aea aead (aired). 

muuariq (mooring) muua muuad (moored). 

flaoriq (flooring) flaoa flaoad (floored). 

faiariq (firing) faia faiad (fired). 



\146 Spoken Engfish II 
flauari (flowery, floury) flaua flauad (flowered). 

leiariq (layering) leia leiad (layered). 

louariq (lowering) loua louad (lowered). 

Note that eia(r) and oua(r) in rapid, especially in vulgar speech, 
often pass into aea(r) and aoa(r). 

When r is preceded by a short vowel, as in 'hurry' (hari), 'merry' 
(meri), no ais generated. 

UNACCENTEd vowEls 

The two chief unaccented vowels in English are aand i, together 
with the rarer o. The former may be regarded as a shortened oe, 
as in 'her', into which it always passes when emphasised or pro­
longed, but it is really nothing but a voice murmur without any 
defInite confIguration. The i is an intermediate vowel between i 
and e and might as well be written e as i. It may be regarded 
either as a very open i or a very close e. 

The following are examples of 0: -

8temt (attempt), Cpouz (oppose), apon (upon), tadei (to-day). 

soufa (sofa), menshan (mention), peishans (patience), krer8t (car­
rot). 

faadha (father), ona (honour), mezha (measure). 

faowad (forward), shepod (shepherd). 

feivarit (favourite), mezhariq (measuring). 

a is often dropped before l~ n and m~ always when the Cis preceded 
by t or d and followed by I or n:-

met! (metal), gaadn (garden), gaadniq (gardening), mom (mut­
ton). 

iivl (evil), loukl (local), simbl (cymbal, symbol). 

When two or more unaccented as or is follow one another, one of 



II Vowels 

them is often thrown out, as in -

hist(a)ri (history), feiv(a)rit (favourite), vedzh{aji}tabl (veg­
etable). 

i is less common than a. It is most usual as a weakening of front 
vowels, especially when i or y is written: -

piti (pity), mandi (Monday). 

divaid (divide), ditekt (detect). 

r:ebit (rabbit), fishiz (fishes), abiliti (ability). 

It is the regular unaccented vowel before dzh, even when a is 
written: -

vilidzh (village), k:eridzh (carriage), kolidzh (college). 

In rapid speech i is apt to .pass into a, except when fmal. 

Unaccented 0 in ordinary speech is simply Orounded. When dwelt 
on it becomes ou. Examples are -

pteito (potato), folo (follow), felo (fellow). 

In rapid speech this 0 passes into a. 
These vowels occur also in unaccented monosyllables. Compare 
'a man' (a m:en) with 'against' (agenst), 'to go' (to gou) with'to­
day' (to dei), 'for all' (fOr aol) with 'forgive' (fOgiv), 'of course' (av 
kaoas) with 'offence' (Ofe ns). 

the and to have two distinct unaccented forms. Before consonants 
they both have a, while before vowels they assume the fuller forms 
dhi and tu: -

dha m:en (the man), dhi ena mi (the enemy). 

to gou (to go), tu enta (to enter). 

CONSONANTS 

As regards the use of the letters there can be no question about 



Spoken English II 
the values of the following: - b, d, f, g, h, k, 1, m, n, p, r, s, t, V, w, 
z. 
This leaves c~ j~ q~ x undisposed of. We also have y, which is not 
required as a vowel-symbol in English. If we allow y to retain its 
present value, we can also retain j as a convenient abbreviation of 
dzh. For tsh we have ch, which, by the omission of the superfluous 
h, can be reduced simply to c. We thus have c andj perfectly paral­
lel. q may very well be taken to represent the back nasal ng. X 
lastly, if employed at all, must in consistency be extended to all kss 
in the language, not only in such words as six, but also in rex 
(wrecks), cex (cheques) and c. 

These contractions fully counterbalance the necessity of retaining 
the digraphs th and sh, to which must of course be added dh and 
zh. Wh is very generally made into w in Southern English, but it is 
well to keep up the distinction on the chance of its being after­
wards revived. The breath yh sometimes occurs in such words as 
'hue' (yhuu), more commonly, however, pronounced hyuu, with a 
separate h before the y. 

Consonants are often dropped in English. Thus the h of the per­
sonal pronouns is generally dropped when they come after a verb 
and are unaccented, as in ai sao im (I saw him). Saw her and soar 
are both pronounced sao. The d of and is generally dropped be­
fore a consonant, as in ct n em gen (cut and come again), where 
the vowel is dropped also on account of the t and n. 

Assimilations also occur in rapid speech. Thus, many people who 
pronounce the q of 'going' and c. quite distinctly in most cases, 
regularly change the back into the point nasal (n), when it is fol­
lowed by a point consonant (t, d, n), as ingouin t ... (going to ... ). 
In I can~t go the t is generally dropped and the point nasal is often 
assimilated to the g by being made into the back nasal q - ai kaaq 
gou.

STRESS iN ENGlislt LANGUAGE 

TRY Tl-tis SI-tORT EXERcisE 

Say this sentence aloud and count how many seconds it takes. 

The beautiful Mountain appeared transfixed in the distance. 

Time required? Probably about 5 seconds. Now, try speaking this 
sentence aloud. 

He can come on Sundays as long as he doesn)t have to do any home­
work in the evening. 

Time required? Probably about 5 seconds. 

Wait a minute the first sentence is much shorter than the second 
sentence! 

The beautiful Mountain appeared transfixed in the distance 

He can come on Sundays as long as he doesn)t have to do any home­
work in the evening 

You are only partially right. 

This simple exercise makes a very important point about how we 
speak and use English. Namely, English is considered a stressed 
language while many other languages are considered syllabic. What 
does that mean? It means that, in English, we give stress to cer­
tain words while other words are quickly spoken (some students 



Spoken English " 

say eaten!). In other languages, such as French or Italian, each 
syllable receives equal importance (there is stress, but each syl­
lable has its own length). 

Many speakers of syllabic languages don't understand why we 
quickly speak or swallow, a number of words in a sentence. In 
syllabic languages each syllable has equal importance and there­
fore equal time is needed. English however, spends more time on 
specific stressed words while quickly gliding over the other, less 
important, words. 

Let's look at a simple example: the modal verb 'can'. When we 
use the positive form of 'can' we quickly glide over the can and it 
is hardly pronounced. 

They can come on Friday. (stressed words underlined) 

On the other hand, when we use the negative form 'can't' we tend to 
stress the fact that it is the negative form by also stressing 'can't'. 

They can't come on Friday. 

As you can see from the above example the sentence, 'They can't 
come on Friday' is longer than 'They can come on Friday' because 
both the modal 'can't' and the verb 'come' are stressed. 

So, what does this mean for your speaking skills? 

Well, first of all, you need to understand which words we gener­
ally stress and which we do not stress. Basically, stress words are 
considered Content Words such as: 

• Nouns e.g. kitchen, Peter 

• (most) principle verbs e.g. visit, construct 

• Adjectives e.g. beautiful, interesting 

• Adverbs e.g. often, carefully 

Non-stressed words are considered Function Words such as 

• Determiners e.g. the, a, some, a few 



II Stress in English Language 

• Auxiliary verbs e.g. don't, am, can, were 

• Prepositions e.g. before, next to, opposite 

• Conjunctions e.g. but, while, as 

• Pronouns e.g. they, she, us 

Let's return to the beginning example to demonstrate how this 
affects speech. 

The beautiful Mountain appeared transfixed in the distance. (14 
syllables) 

He can come on Sundays as long as he doesnJt have to do any home­
work in the evening. (22 syllables) 

Even though the second sentence is approximately 30% longer 
than the first, the sentences take the same time to speak. This is 
because there are 5 stressed words in each sentence. From this ex­
ample, you can see that you needn't worry about p,ronouncing 
every word clearly to be understood. You should however, con­
centrate on pronouncing the stressed words clearly. 

Now, do some listening comprehension or go speak to your na­
tive English speaking friends and listen to how they concentrate 
on the stressed words rather than giving importance to each syl­
lable. You will soon find that you can understand and communi­
cate more because you begin to listen for (and use in speaking) 
stressed words. All those words that you thought you didn't un­
derstand are really not crucial for understanding the sense or 
making yourself understood. Stressed words are the key to excel­
lent pronunciation and understanding of English.

F, is like f in English. 

Fh, is silent, except in the three words jhein,jhuair,jhathast, when 
it has the sound of h. 

M, is like m in English. 



" 54 Spoken English II 
Mh, is like v and more nasal than bh. It is silent in the middle and 
end of some words and gives a nasal sound to the vowel. In some 
districts it has the sound of u, as, samhradh, pronounced sauradh.

C, is always hard, before a, 0, u, it has the sound of c in can, after 
a, 0, u, it has the same sound in some districts, as, cnoc, like ck in 
lock, but more generally the sound of chk, before e, i and after i, 
like c in came. 

Ch, preceded or followed by a, o. u, has a gutteral sound like ch in

Sh, has the sound of h. 

L, before or after a, o. u and II after a, 0, u, have a flatter sound 
than I in English and is produced by pressing the point of the

the sound is like II in million. It has a simple sound after i and 
when aspirated it is like I in English. 

N, in conjunction with a, o. u, is like n in English, m has a flatter 
sound, with e, i, it has a slender sound like n in pinion, n aspirated 
has the sound of n in English, after c, g, m, t, it resembles the

sounded as two syllables, thus, flar;g (fearug), dealbh (dealuv), 
marbh (maruv). 

The letters 1, n, have an aspirated sound, though the aspirate let­
ter is not used, so also has r though much slighter. 

ENqlisli is NOT pliONETic 

Always remember that English is not 'phonetic'. That means that 
we do not always say a word the same way that we spell it. 

Some words can have the same spelling but different pronuncia­
tion, for example: 

I like to read [ri:d]. 

I have read [red] that book. 

Some words have different spelling but the same pronunciation, 
for example: 

I have read [red] that book. 

My favourite colour is red [red].

WORd STRESS 

Word stress is your magic key to understanding spoken English. 
Native speakers of English use word stress naturally. Word stress 
is so natural for them that they don't even know they use it. Non­
native speakers who speak English to native speakers without using 
word stress, encounter two problems: 

1. They find it difficult to understand native speakers, especially 
those speaking fast. 

2. The native speakers may fmd it difficult to understand them. 

TI-IREE kiNds of WORd STRESS 

1. Syllables with primary stress are in uppercase. 

2. Syllables with secondary stress are in lowercase. 

3. Syllables with reduced stress have a line through them. 

• INtellect 

• exPOnent

• OScilate 

• eQUIPment

Each unstressed vowel has a line through it. Each syllable with

• A multi-syllable word has a prominent syllable. This is called 
a stressed syllable. 

• Stressed syllable is longer in duration, higher in pitch and 
louder in volume. 

• Duration is the primary attribute to the prominence of a syl­
lable. 

• Usually 2 syllable nouns (90%+) have the stress on the first 
syllable. 2 syllable verbs (60% +) have the stress on the sec­
ond. 

• Except for the compounds, stressed syllables in words with 
more than 2 syllables never stand next to each other (Stressed 
syllables and weak. syllables alternate). 

When a word has more than one syllable, one is more prominent 
than the others. When this happens, we say that the syllable has a 
stress or that it is stressed. In the following examples, stressed 
syllables are expressed with italics.

SENTENCE STRESS iN ENGlish 

Sentence stress is the music of spoken English. Like word stress, 
sentence stress can help you to understand spoken English, espe­
cially when spoken fast. 

Sentence stress is what gives English its rhythm or 'beat'. 

You remember that word stress is accent on one syllable within a 
word. 

Sentence stress is accent on certain words within a sentence. 

Most sentences have two types of word: 

l.content words 

2.structure words 

Content words are the key words of a sentence. They are the 
important words that carry the meaning or sense. 

Structure words are not very important words. They are small, 
simple words that make the sentence correct grammatically. They 
give the sentence its correct form or 'structure'. 

If you remove the structure words from a sentence, you will prob­
ably still understand the sentence. 

If you remove the content words from a sentence, you will not 
understand the sentence. The sentence has no sense or meaning. 

Imagine that you receive this telegram message: 

Will you SELL me CAR because I'm GONE to FRANCE 

This sentence is not complete. It is not a 'grammatically correct' 
sentence. But you probably understand it. These 4 words com-



Spoken English II 
municate very well. Somebody wants you to sell their car for them 
because they have gone to France. We can add a few words: 

Will you SELL my CAR because Pve 
GONE to FRANCE 

The new words do not really add any more information. But they 
make the message more correct grammatically. We can add even 
more words to make one complete, grammatically correct sen­
tence. But the information is the same: 

Content Words 

Will you SELL my CAR because Pve GONE to FRA 
-NCE. 

Structure Words 

In our sentence, the 4 key words (sell, car, gone, France) are accen­
tuated or stressed. 

Why is this important for pronunciation? It is important because 
it adds 'music' to the language. It is the rhythm of the English 
language. It changes the speed at which we speak (and listen to) 
the language. The time between each stressed word is the same. 

In our sentence, there is 1 syllable between SELL and CAR and 3 
syllables between CAR and GONE. But the time (t) between SELL 
and CAR and between CAR and GONE is the same. We main­
tain a constant beat on the stressed words. To do this, we say 'my' 
more slowly and 'because I've' more quickly. We change the speed 
of the small structure words so that the rhythm of the key content 
words stays the same.

RuLES FOR SENTENCE STRESS iN ENGliSH 

The basic rules of sentence stress are: 

1. content words are stressed 

2. structure words are unstressed 

3. the time between stressed words is always the same 

The following tables can help you decide which words are content 
words and which words are structtl,re rPm-ds: 

Content words 

Words carrying the meaning Example 

main verbs SELL, GIVE, EMPLOY 

Nouns CAR, MUSIC, MARY 

adjectives RED, BIG, INTERESTING 

Adverbs QUICKLY, LOUDLY, NEVER 

negative auxiliaries DON'T, AREN'T, CAN'T 

Structure words 

Words for correct grammar Example 

pronouns he, we, they 

prepositions on, at, into 

.Articles a, an, the 

conjunctions and, but, because 

auxiliary verbs do, be, have, can, must 

'to be' as a main verb IS, are, was 

EXCEPTioNS 

The above rules are for what is called 'neutral' or normal stress. 



Spoken English 1/ 

But sometimes we can stress a word that would normally be only 
a structure word, for example to correct information. 

Look at the following dialogue: 

"Have you seen ET?" 

"No, I- haven't' bu-t he has."

CONVERSATioN 

Using dialogues to help anybody develop their conversation skills 
is common practice in English. One of the main advantages to 
using dialogues is that people are given a rubric as a basis on 
which they can then build. Once they have become comfonable 
using a dialogue, they can then go on to have related conversa­
tions building on their familiarity with the dialogue and the vo­
cabulary specific to the situation. 

Here are links to various dialogues, which can use in the daily life. 
Each dialogue is presented in full and focuses on a specific topic.

PhRASAL VERbs 
Phrasal verbs are part of a large group of verbs called 'multi-word 
verbs'. Phrasal verbs and other multi-word verbs are an important 
part of the English language. Multi-word verbs, including phrasal 
verbs, are very common, especially in spoken English. A multi-word 
verb is a verb like 'pick up', 'turn on' or 'get on with'. For conve­
nience, many people refer to all multi-word verbs as phrasal verbs. 
These verbs consist of a basic verb + another word or words. The other 
word(s) can be prepositions and/or adverbs. The two or three words 
that make up multi-word verbs form a short 'phrase'-which is why 
these verbs are often all called 'phrasal verbs'. 

The important thing to remember is that a multi-word verb is 
still a verb. 'Get' is a verb. 'Get up', is also a verb, a different verb. 
'Get' and 'get up' are two different verbs. They do not have the 
same meaning. So you should treat each multi-word verb as a 
separate verb and learn it like any other verb. Look at these ex­
amples. You can see that there are three types of multi-word verb: 

single-word verb look direct your You must 
eyes ill a look before 
certain you leap. 
direction 

multi prepositional look after take care of Who is 
-word verbs lookingaf 
verbs ter the

Prepositional verbs cannot be separated. That means that we can­
not put the direct object between the two parts. For example, we 
must say 'look after the baby'. We cannot say 'look the baby after': 

PhRASAl"'PREposiTioNAl VERbs 



II Prepositional Verbs 193 11 

Phrasal-prepositional verbs are a small group of multi-word verbs 
made from a verb plus another word or words. Many people re­
fer to all multi-word verbs as phrasal verbs. We make a distinc­
tion between three types of multi-word verbs: prepositional verbs, 
phrasal verbs and phrasal-prepositional verbs. We will look at 
phrasal-prepositional verbs. 

Phrasal-prepositional verbs are made of: verb + adverb + prepo­
sition 

Look at these examples of phrasal-prepositional verbs: 

phrasal meaning examples direct

put up with tolerate I won't put your atti 
up with -tude. 

look forward to anticipate with I look seemg 
pleasure forward to you. 

run out of use up, exhaust We have run eggs. 
out of 

Because phrasal-prepositional verbs end with a preposition, there 
is always a direct object. And, like prepositional verbs, phrasal­
prepositional verbs cannot be separated. Look at these examples:

SLANGS 
Slangs are used in highly informal speech that is outside conven­
tional or standard usage and consists both of coined words and 
phrases, and of new or extended meanings attached to established 
terms. Slang develops from the attempt to find fresh and vigor­
ous, colourful, pungent or humorous expression and generally 
either passes into disuse or comes to have a more formal status. 
Slangs are used as an informal speech and make the language 
more user friendly. It makes spoken English more colourful and 
helps you express your thoughts in a better manner. Examples of 
some common slangs, along with their meanings and examples 
are given below: 

AVERAGE JOE 

Definition: Someone who is just like everyone else, a normal per­
son. 

Example: 1) Mickey is your average Joe - he likes football, hates 
opera and thinks it's a crime to do any work on weekends. 

Etymology: 1\.verage' means 'in the middle' or 'not extreme' and 
'Joe' is a common male name. So 'average Joe' refers to a man 
who is not extremely different from everyone else.

Example: 1) Miranda is the apple of my eye - I love her more than

centre) was called the 'apple'. It was thought that the pupil was a 
round object much like an apple (a piece of fruit). When you look 
at someone, their reflection appears in your pupil. So if someone 
is the 'apple of your eye', he or she is someone that you look at a 
lot and enjoy seeing.
